# Checkers
This project is a Checkers console game made in C++.
This was a project that allowed me to try an object-oriented language because it was my first project made in C++.
  
Most of the rules are implemented and you can play the game using the keyboard and the checkers coordenates.

The project also has some additional features like:  
  * Colors, for a more intuitive play and a better experience;  
  * Human vs Human;  
  * Human vs Bot;
