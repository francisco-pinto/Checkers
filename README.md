# Checkers
This project is a Checkers console game made in C++.
This was a project that allowed me to try an object-oriented language because this was my first project made in C++.
  
Most of the rules are implemented and yuo can play the game using the keyboard and the checkers coordenates.

The project have also some additional features like:  
  -> Colors, for a more intuitive play and a better experience;  
  -> Human vs Human;  
  -> Human vs Bot;
